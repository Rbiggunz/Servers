make as a separate file and then add through website_name.vhost file like so:

### Nginx configuration.
server {
    listen 80; # IPv4
    server_name www.cruise.belfast-harbour.co.uk cruise.belfast-harbour.co.uk;
    return 301 https://cruise.belfast-harbour.co.uk$request_uri;

}

server {

    ## Include general nginx hardening rules.
    include sites-available/general_hardening.conf;

    ## Customer redirects
    include sites-available/redirects.conf;
    
    ## WP Hardening
    include sites-available/wp_hardening.conf;
}


here is the code example:

## Protect the readme.html file to not reveal the installed
## version.
location = /readme.html {
        limit_req zone=req_limit_per_ip burst=10 nodelay;
        #return 404; nginx served error
        return 301 /404; # WordPress served error.
}

## Protect the readme.html file to not reveal the installed
## version.
location = /wp-config.php {
        limit_req zone=req_limit_per_ip burst=10 nodelay;
            #return 404; nginx served error.
           return 301 /404; # WordPress served error.
}

location  /wp-admin {
        # Redirect 403 errors to / to fool attackers
        error_page 403 = @admin_ban;
       
        # Restricted access to WordPress backend.
        allow 212.108.72.0/24;
        deny all;
        
        # Send to PHP
#        include fastcgi.conf;
 #       fastcgi_pass example_cgi;
#         try_files $uri $uri/;

}

location ~ ^/wp-login.php {        
        # Redirect 403 errors to / to fool attackers
        error_page 403 = @admin_ban;

        # Restricted access to WordPress backend.
        allow 212.108.72.0/24;

        fastcgi_pass example_cgi;
}
