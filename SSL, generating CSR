after generating a .key file and .csr, just need to include .key and .crt files in .vhosts.

If SSL doesn't work, just need to rekey the certificate.

Potential workflow:
1. Generate new key and csr:
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout trinseo.key -out trinseo.csr

2. Request rekey certificate, wate till it is approved and download the new package.

3. Combine crt and bundle in 1 file:
cat trinseo.crt gd_bundle-g2-g1.crt > bundle_chained.crt

4. In .vhosts replace old crt and key with new crt bundle and new key;
